# Project_Data-analysis-on-Power-Station-Dataset
**Client backgorund**  
The client is invited by a solar PV station company to inject capital in the JV which invests on the new power stations,and he hopes to evaluate the return based on the market and economics analysis from estimating the electricity supply and demand in the following years.  
**The requirement**  
Decompose, downside and sample the big data for further analysis, including optimization modeling, machine learning and financial modeling.  
**Our solution**  
With our methodology, we will generate the electricy demand dataset and power generating dataset for analysis. The way we are using is to downside the dataset as a smaller dataset that retains the key information of the orginial one, and breaks into 6 steps to complete.  
**KPI**  
- Achieve maximum reduction of Big Data. 
- Achieve minimum loss of inforamtion.
